<p>I am a front-end web developer with extensive graphic design and digital media experience. In addition to my BFA in graphic design, I have received a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from Georgia Tech. My combination of formal education and self-teaching has given me the ability to both design and code websites and apps completely from scratch. In particular, I am very comfortable creating custom CSS, though I am also experienced with using frameworks, especially Tailwind, on collaborative projects.</p>

<p>If you'd like to add my unique designer-developer skillset to your team, please reach out to <a href="mailto:me@ckboyt.com">me@ckboyt.com</a> or one of my social links above! I am open to both volunteer work for open source projects as well as paid opportunities.</p>
